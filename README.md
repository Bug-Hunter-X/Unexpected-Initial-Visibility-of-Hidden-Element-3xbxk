# Unexpected Initial Visibility of Hidden Element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where an element intended to be hidden initially is unexpectedly visible.  The issue stems from the lack of explicit display style setting.  The bug.html file shows the problem, and the bugSolution.html file presents the solution.

## Bug Description:

A div element is designed to be hidden until a button is clicked.  However, it remains visible upon initial page load. This is a subtle issue that can be easily missed.

## Solution:

The solution involves explicitly setting the `display` style of the div to `none` in the HTML or associated CSS to ensure it is hidden upon page load.
